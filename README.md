# HackAnalysis
A list of methods and a workflow to validate, review and create reports for git repositories (projects). Useful for Hackathons.

## Scope

Create an html (or txt) report for a Git project with the following information.

  [ ] 1) Get a list of the software used (name, type, link).
  [ ] 2) Find frameworks used.
  [ ] 3) Get the licenses for each dependency used. Are there any non-free software used without mention it?
  [ ] 4) Search for "similar" repos (projects) on Google, GitHub, Gitlab etc (title, code pieces, funcionality, tags).
  [ ] 5) Show commits timeline by author with visualization (use GitHub Pulse).
  [ ] 6) Check all the required files are included (License, README with installation info, db file).
  [ ] 7) Follow the instructions and check the project can be installed (reproduce locally).
  [ ] 8) Check media used (eg demo images, logos etc) have a propriate license (copyright issues).
  [ ] 9) Make a Static Code (Software) Analysis (for the main project language).
  [ ] 10) Are there any commits during the "forced break"?
